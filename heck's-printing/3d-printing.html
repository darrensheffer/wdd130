                <h1>Welcome to the world of 3D printing!</h1>
                <p>There is an infinite number of things you can do with a 3d printer!  Just a few examples are bath toys, decorative objects for shelves, prints to fix or replace broken parts, and even gifts!</p>

                    <p>This 3D print was my first attempt at designing my own object for 3D printing.  I started by using references to create a 3D model in a free program called Blender.  This process can be skipped if you decide to purchase or download an already created 3D model.  Afterdownloading or creating your 3D model, transger the file into a slicer program of your choice.  I used the free program called Prusa Slicer for this project.  After adjusting the settings recommended for my 3D printer model, it was time to print!  Just a few hours later, Clover was printed and ready for assembly.  Using superglue and some dowels I printed with Clover, I was able to piece her together.  After a light sanding to take off some of the rough edges, she was ready for painting.  A few coats of primer and some acrylic paint later, Clover is complete!  Clover is now the proud staff of my friend who takes her to Comicons and Halloween parties!</p>

                <p>If you have a 3D printer and would like to try your hand at making an original design, try blender to make your creations!  And to be able to print your creations or something you have downloaded, give Prusa Slicer a try.  Both programs are free and also have plenty of tutorials online and Youtube for any questions you may have!</p>
