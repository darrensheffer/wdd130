        <p>With all the information that is readily available online, there are millions of helpful sites that will help you along your way to learning. I am here to offer a small portion of my prints, ideas, and settings in hopes it helps you be able to print higher quality prints for yourselves. There are many types of ways to bring your art into the real world like drawing a picture or crafting using clay, wood, or steel. These, however, take years of practice and in some cases very expensive tools to create, that is why my preferred way is to use 3D and laser printing. These two methods allow you to create just about anything you can imagine! Want to make your own flowerpots with distinct and original designs? Use a 3D printer to bring your vision to reality! Maybe you want to add a nativity scene etched into wood or tile. Use a laser printer to precisely create the perfect decoration for the holidays!</p>
