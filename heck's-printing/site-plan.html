      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My website's purpose is to bring more people into the hobby of 3d printing and laser engraving.  It can be used to make money if you sell your printed items, but that is not it's main draw.  Being able to create just about anything you can imagine in extremely fine detail opens up so many possibilities for people to explore.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is those who are thinking about getting into 3d printing and those who don't yet know they are interested in starting their own 3d printing journey.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        With all the information that is readily available online, there are millions of helpful sites that will help you along your way to learning.  I am here to offer a small portion of my prints, ideas, and settings in hopes it helps you be able to print higher quality prints for yourselves.  
        There are many types of ways to bring your art into the real world like drawing a picture or crafting using clay, wood, or steel.  These, however, take years of practice and in some cases very expensive tools to create, that is why my preferred way is to use 3D and laser printing.  These two methods allow you to create just about anything you can imagine!  Want to make your own flowerpots with distinct and original designs?  Use a 3D printer to bring your vision to reality!  Maybe you want to add a nativity scene etched into wood or tile.  Use a laser printer to precisely create the perfect decoration for the holidays!

      <h3>3D Printing</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the world of 3D printing!  There is an infinite number of things you can do with a 3D printer.  Just a few examples are bath toys for children or yourself, decorative shelving objects, prints to fix or replace broken parts of other objects, and even gifts.
        Meet Clover!
        This 3D print was my first attempt at designing my own object for 3D printing.  I started by using references to create a 3D model in Blender.  This process can be skipped if you decide to purchase or download a file already made.  I then transferred the Blender file into a program called Prusa Slicer that was set up for my printer.  In Prusa Slicer, I was able to adjust the printer and file settings to be ready for the final print.  After the printing was done, I used Superglue to glue the halves together.  After a little bit of sanding, I sprayed a few coats of primer onto it and painted it.  This print was given to my friend who used it for a staff in their cosplay.  If you have a 3D printer and want to try your hand at making an original design, both Blender and Prusa Slicer are free software and have tutorials for any questions you might have YouTube.

      <h3>Laser Engraving</h3>
      <p>
        Laser engravings are becoming more and more popular these days.  Whether you are a beginner trying it as a hobby, or an experienced craftsman looking to start or expand your business, there is a laser engraver that is just right for you!  
        With a laser engraver machine, you can produce precise and repeatable engravings and cuttings on a variety of materials.  These include wood, stone, foam, glass, acrylic, and fabric.  The engraving does not have to be flat!  For example, if you want to engrave a horse onto a mug for a present, the engraver can do that!  Or maybe you want to engrave a Ninetails that you drew into wood, it will create your masterpiece in perfect detail!
