                <h1>Welcome to the world of Laser Engraving!</h1>
                <p>Laser engravings are becoming more and more popular these days.  Whether you are a beginner trying it as a hobby, or an experienced craftsman looking to start or expand your business, there is a laser engraver that is just right for you!  With a laser engraving machine, you can produce precise and repeatable engravings and cuttings on a variety of materials.  These include, but not limited to, wood, stone, foam, glass, acrylic, and fabric.  The engravings do not all have to be flat!  For example, if you want to enggrave a horse onto a water bottle for a present, some engravers can do that!  Or maybe you just want to engrave some art that you drew, it will create your masterpiece in perfect detail!</p>

                <p class="text-p">Laser engraving can be used in a variaty of ways!  my latest project I have been working on is a Gimli costume from The Lord of the Rings.  Here is Gimli's helmet I made by using my laser engraver to cut out the pieces of foam and gluing them together with some contact cement.  After a little primer and some paint, the helmet is ready for battle!</p>

                <p class="text-p">No warrior outfit would be complete without having some sort of chainmail!  With the right pattern and some 2 millimeter foam, your laser engraver can turn out chainmail by the sheets in minutes!  here are two different sizes of the chainmail that I am working with at the moment.  The benefits of using foam over metal chainmail is the weight, ease of construction, and the price.</p>
